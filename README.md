# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Prediction Using Scikit-learn

Predict the type of forest cover from cartographic variables using machine learning models built with **Scikit-learn**.  
This project is inspired by a real-world dataset from the **U.S. Forest Service** and aims to assist in **vegetation mapping**, **ecological research**, and **environmental planning**.

## 📌 Overview

In this project, we aim to build a classification model that can accurately predict the **forest cover type** in a given geographic area based on topographic and soil attributes.

### 🔍 Objectives

- Analyze the Covertype dataset from UCI
- Preprocess and explore the features
- Train multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate models using accuracy and F1-score
- Build an interactive Streamlit app for visualization

### 🔸 Cover Types (Target Classes):

1. Spruce/Fir
2. Lodgepole Pine
3. Ponderosa Pine
4. Cottonwood/Willow
5. Aspen
6. Douglas-fir
7. Krummholz

### 🔸 Feature Types:

- **Elevation**, **Aspect**, **Slope**
- **Soil type** (40 binary features)
- **Wilderness Area** (4 binary features)
- Hillshade values at different times
- Horizontal/Vertical distances to various features
